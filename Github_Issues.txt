Model appraisal and resolution matrice 


ICSD future enhancement list

Future versions of ISCD algorithm could take those directions:

- [ ] add time-lapse inversion procedure 
- [ ] add anisotropic spatial regularisation in 3d
- [ ] think about possible MALM coupled inversion with ERT or structural inversion or petrophysical

Data weigting

- [ ] use a normal-reciprocal analysis and compute data weigting

Add examples and test data

Preparation for merge request

Main changes:
- ICSD arguments are not anymore parsed using cmd line 
- add 3d spatial regularisation for unstructured mesh using the k-dist method
- add 2d anisotropic spatial regularisation
- add option to relative smallness constrainst. The initial model m0 comes from a single-source misfit minimisation.

Add exemple and test data:
- [ ] landfill 3d structured mesh (not published yet)
- [ ] Root Water Uptake 3d unstructured mesh - published in SOIL (Mary et al. 2019)
- [ ] More examples and test data will be referenced in a coming issue
